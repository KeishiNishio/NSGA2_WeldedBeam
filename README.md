## NSGA-II Algorithm

The NSGA-II is a powerful algorithm for problems with multiple objectives. It has been developed to identify a set of Pareto-optimal solutions from an evolving population. The computational process is as follows:

1. **Generation of Initial Candidates**: Generate candidates randomly and evaluate them against each objective.

2. **Selection and Reproduction**: Select well-balanced candidates and generate new ones.

3. **Iteration**: Repeat the above steps, progressively approaching the ideal solution.

## Applications and Advantages

Evolutionary computation and NSGA-II can be applied to real-world problems, such as simultaneously optimizing the battery life and processor power of smartphones.

## Overview of the Source Code
The Welded Beam Problem is a multi-objective optimization problem related to the design of a welded beam, aiming to minimize cost while controlling the deflection of the beam. This problem includes several physical constraints that directly affect the strength and stability of the welded beam.
